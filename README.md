# Push_Swap ðŸ§®
## Summary
Push_swap is an algorithm project in which we are to sort data in ascending order on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Usage
Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:mpeterson114/push_swap.git
```
then enter into the cloned directory and run the command ```make``` to compile.
You can then run the program with the following:
```
./push_swap <numbers of your choice>
```
with any range or number of values passed as arguments, positive or negative, as long as there are no duplicates. For example:
```
./push_swap -4 2147483647 0 22 892 -2147483648
```
To test with a larger range or number of values, you can use a random number generator like [this](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php)
*Keep **Allow Repeats** set to **No**, and **Sort** set to **Do not sort**

Copy the randomly generated numbers and paste them into the command line as arguments to be passed with ```./push_swap```
Here is an example testing with 100 values ranging from -500 to 500:
```
./push_swap -209 407 160 188 416 360 444 -213 90 -376 297 -143 206 -226 413 43 -434 149 201 101 -382 113 150 -25 340 -463 469 -185 242 -410 250 -317 -197 -267 -357 -44 286 142 301 121 358 -142 -269 -249 -255 -146 -485 84 -391 -437 -479 -358 306 -54 362 122 157 323 -242 -487 -16 262 -68 -59 354 379 -422 404 -336 370 -76 405 -296 -459 302 -349 -137 -205 -268 -340 -168 -375 275 397 -12 96 -307 172 394 -303 462 -286 -328 217 289 332 -300 -204 399 78
```
The result will be a list of the sorting operations needed to sort the values in ascending order.
