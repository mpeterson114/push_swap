# Push_Swap ðŸ§®
## Summary
Push_swap is an algorithm project in which we are to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Usage
Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:mpeterson114/push_swap.git
```
then enter into the cloned directory and run the command ```make``` to compile.
You can then run the program with the following:
```
./push_swap <numbers of your choice>
```
with any range or number of values passed as arguments, positive or negative, as long as there are no duplicates. For example:
```
./push_swap -4 2147483647 0 22 892 -2147483648
```
To test with a larger range or number of values, you can use a random number generator like the
